## Multipeer Connectivity Framework. Make a multipeer photo sharing app in just 150 lines of code.

üí° what was learned:

- Multipeer Connectivity Framework
- MCBrowserViewControllerDelegate, MCSessionDelegate
- MCSession, MCAdvertiserAssistant, MCPeerID, MCBrowserViewController

## Challenge:

- [ ] Show an alert when a user has disconnected from our multipeer network. Something like ‚ÄúPaul‚Äôs iPhone has disconnected‚Äù is enough.
- [ ] Try sending text messages across the network. You can create a Data from a string using Data(yourString.utf8), and convert a Data back to a string by using String(decoding: yourData, as: UTF8.self).
- [ ] Add a button that shows an alert controller listing the names of all devices currently connected to the session ‚Äì use the connectedPeers property of your session to find that information.






## Important notes:

Multipeer connectivity requires four new classes:

1) MCSession is the manager class that handles all multipeer connectivity for us.
2) MCPeerID identifies each user uniquely in a session.
3) MCAdvertiserAssistant is used when creating a session, telling others that we exist and handling invitations.
4) MCBrowserViewController is used when looking for sessions, showing users who is nearby and letting them join.
