## Challenge

- [x] The pictures we‚Äôre using in have other ball pictures rather than just ‚ÄúballRed‚Äù. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
- [x] Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
- [ ] Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
