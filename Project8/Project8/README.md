## Challenge

- [x] Use the techniques you learned in project 2 to draw a thin gray line around the buttons view, to make it stand out from the rest of the UI.
- [x] If the user enters an incorrect guess, show an alert telling them they are wrong. Youâ€™ll need to extend the submitTapped() method so that if firstIndex(of:) failed to find the guess you show the alert.
- [x] Try making the game also deduct points if the player makes an incorrect guess. Think about how you can move to the next level â€“ we canâ€™t use a simple division remainder on the playerâ€™s score any more, because they might have lost some points.
